REFACTORING ANALYSIS:

**CODE SMELLS TO IDENTIFY:**
☐ Long Method (>50 lines)
☐ Large Class (>300 lines)
☐ Long Parameter List (>3-4 params)
☐ Duplicate Code
☐ Dead Code
☐ Speculative Generality
☐ Feature Envy
☐ Data Clumps
☐ Primitive Obsession
☐ Switch Statements (consider polymorphism)
☐ Lazy Class
☐ Inappropriate Intimacy
☐ Message Chains
☐ Middle Man
☐ Divergent Change
☐ Shotgun Surgery
☐ Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies

**REFACTORING TECHNIQUES:**
- Extract Method/Function
- Rename Variable/Function
- Move Method/Field
- Inline Function
- Extract Class
- Introduce Parameter Object
- Replace Magic Number with Constant
- Decompose Conditional
- Consolidate Conditional
- Replace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses
- Replace Type Code with Polymorphism
- Introduce Null Object
- Extract Interface
- Replace Inheritance with Delegation

🔧 REFACTORING ANALYSIS

Code Quality: [Current state assessment]

🔴 CODE SMELLS DETECTED:

1. [Smell Name] - Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
   Location: [File:Line]
   Problem: [Description]
   Impact: [Why this matters]

2. [Smell Name] - Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
   ...

💡 REFACTORING PLAN:

Refactoring 1: [Technique Name]
Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
Complexity: [Simple/Moderate/Complex]

Before:
[Original code]

After:
[Refactored code]

Benefits:
- [Improvement 1]
- [Improvement 2]

Risks: [If any]
Testing Strategy: [How to verify no breakage]

Refactoring 2: [Technique Name]
...

📋 STEP-BY-STEP REFACTORING SEQUENCE:
(Ordered for safety - do in this order)

Step 1: [Refactoring name]
   Why first: [Reason]
   Test after: [What to verify]

Step 2: [Refactoring name]
   Why second: [Reason]
   Test after: [What to verify]

🎯 EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
After refactoring:
✓ [Improvement 1]
✓ [Improvement 2]
✓ [Improvement 3]

Metrics:
- Lines of code: [Before] → [After]
- Cyclomatic complexity: [Before] → [After]
- Duplication: [Before] → [After]
- Test coverage: [Before] → [After]

⚠️ SAFETY MEASURES:
1. Ensure tests exist (write if needed)
2. Commit before each refactoring step
3. Run tests after each step
4. Use IDE refactoring tools when possible
5. Peer review changes

🧪 TESTING CHECKLIST:
☐ All existing tests pass
☐ No new bugs introduced
☐ Behavior unchanged
☐ Performance not degraded
☐ Edge cases still handled
```

REFACTORING PRINCIPLES:
✓ Small steps, frequent testing
✓ One refactoring at a time
✓ Keep functionality unchanged
✓ Ensure tests exist first
✓ Commit after each successful refactoring
✓ Don't add features while refactoring
✓ Make it work, make it right, make it fast

REFACTORING PATTERNS:

**Extract Method:**
When: Method too long or code needs comment to explain
How: Extract code into well-named method

**Introduce Parameter Object:**
When: Many parameters passed together
How: Create object to group related parameters

**Replace Conditional with Polymorphism:**
When: Switch on type code
How: Create subclasses for each type
