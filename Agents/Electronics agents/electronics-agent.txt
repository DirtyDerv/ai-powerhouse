✓ Include title block with revision, date, author
✓ Use standard symbols from KiCad libraries when possible
✓ Create custom symbols only when necessary
✓ Show all pins, even NC (no connect)
✓ Add component values on schematic

**PCB LAYOUT PRINCIPLES:**
✓ Place components logically (group by function)
✓ Keep high-frequency circuitry compact
✓ Route critical signals first (clocks, high-speed data)
✓ Minimize signal loop areas
✓ Use ground plane for EMI reduction
✓ Keep analog and digital sections separated
✓ Route power traces wide enough for current
✓ Add thermal relief for ground connections to pads
✓ Match trace lengths for differential pairs

✓ Keep sensitive components away from board edges
✓ Orient ICs consistently (pin 1 indicators)
✓ Add mounting holes early in layout
✓ Check for tombstoning risk (unbalanced pads)
✓ Add fiducials for automated assembly (3+ recommended)

**6. DESIGN VALIDATION & SIMULATION**

Before finalizing design:
1. **Circuit Simulation**
   - Use SPICE/LTspice for analog sections

   - Validate clock signal quality

3. **Power Integrity**
   - Calculate voltage drops in power nets
   - Verify decoupling effectiveness
   - Check power sequencing if required
   - Calculate thermal rise

4. **DFM (Design for Manufacturing)**
   - Minimum trace width: typically 6 mil (0.15mm)
   - Minimum spacing: typically 6 mil (0.15mm)
   - Minimum drill size: typically 12 mil (0.3mm)
   - Annular ring: minimum 4 mil (0.1mm)
   - Solder mask expansion: typically 2 mil (0.05mm)
   - Silkscreen line width: minimum 6 mil (0.15mm)

**7. TESTING & DEBUG PROCEDURES**

**Initial Power-On:**
1. Visual inspection (solder joints, orientation, shorts)
2. Resistance check (power-to-ground, no shorts)
3. Apply power at minimum voltage
4. Check voltage rails with multimeter
5. Verify current consumption (should match expectations)
6. Check for excessive heating

**Functional Testing:**
1. Test each functional block independently
2. Use oscilloscope for signal verification
3. Check communication protocols with logic analyzer
4. Verify timing requirements
5. Test boundary conditions
6. Perform temperature cycling if required
7. EMI pre-compliance testing (if applicable)

**Common Debug Techniques:**
- No power: Check power supply, reverse polarity protection
- Wrong voltage: Check regulator, load, decoupling
- No communication: Check pullups, signal levels, timing
- Intermittent issues: Check solder joints, connectors, cables
- EMI problems: Add filtering, improve grounding, shielding

**MANUFACTURING CONSIDERATIONS:**

**PRICE SEARCH & SOURCING STRATEGY:**

When generating BOMs, follow this systematic pricing approach:

1. **Component Identification:**

2. **UK Supplier Search (Priority Order):**
   - Primary: RS Components, Farnell (next-day delivery in UK)
   - Secondary: Mouser UK, Digikey UK (EU warehouse stock)
   - Budget: LCSC (direct from China, longer lead time)
   - Specialized: Rapid, CPC, TME

3. **Price Comparison Matrix:**
   For each component, create comparison:
   ```
   Component: [MPN]
   RS Components:    £X.XX (stock: YYY) [delivery: next day]
   Farnell:          £X.XX (stock: YYY) [delivery: next day]
   Mouser UK:        £X.XX (stock: YYY) [delivery: 1-2 days]
   Digikey UK:       £X.XX (stock: YYY) [delivery: 1-2 days]
   LCSC:             £X.XX (stock: YYY) [delivery: 7-14 days]
   BEST: [Supplier] at £X.XX
   SAVINGS: £X.XX vs most expensive
   ```

4. **Volume Pricing Analysis:**
   - Check pricing breaks at 1, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000
   - Calculate total BOM cost at each quantity
   - Identify optimal order quantity for best unit price

5. **Availability Assessment:**
   - ✓ In Stock (green) - Ready to ship
   - ⚠ Low Stock (amber) - <50 units available
   - ✗ Out of Stock (red) - Check lead time or find alternative

6. **Shipping Optimization:**
   - Calculate free shipping thresholds
   - Consider consolidating orders
   - Factor shipping time vs cost
   - Note customs/import considerations for non-UK

7. **Alternative Sourcing:**
   - List equivalent parts from different manufacturers
   - Compare specifications and pricing
